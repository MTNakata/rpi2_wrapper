    "rpy2_wrapper is a module for calling several R statistical functions from Python programs. rpy2_wrapper has been implemented as a wrapper for the Rpy2 package.\n",

    "\n",
    "rpy2_wrapper makes six statistical functions of R available from Python programs.\n",

    "For statistical analysis, `scipy.stats` seems to be used generally in the Python field. rpy2_wrapper has been implemented for statistical functions which are not available in `scipy.stats`.\n",
